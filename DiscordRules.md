# Productionists Discord Rule Draft

This document is for discussion and changes

## General Rules

In general, moderators reserve the right to say when a conversation has gone too far or if a person has stepped over the line. These specific rules are merely a reflection of the expectations here on this server.

1. No harassment, discrimination or abuse of any kind (be respectful).
   1. No excessive cursing, or sexual content. There is zero tolerance for slurs, racism or hatespeech on this server.
2. No NSFW, drug, pornography, sexually explicit or suggestive material.
   1. Unless in an artistic context or with the permission of the moderators.
3. No spam
   1. This includes server invites, mass mentions, caps, screamers, and link spam.
4. No trolling, and heavy politics.
   1. This includes flame wars, and political or religious shouting matches. While these topics are allowed, moderators are here to do exactly that - keep things civil.
5. No advertising of any kind.
6. No sharing of illegal content.
7. No sharing of private information.
8. Keep channel discussion on topic.
9. No abusing custom emotes or reactions.
10. No asking for free stuff, to use your bot, for mod, or custom roles.
11. No blank names.
12. No off topic, or offensive memes.
13. Don't tag staff unless there is an issue, or if they are participating in chat.
14. No shitposting.
15. No self-bots or user-bots.
16. No begging or asking for Nitro.

## Nickname policy

In order to keep things pleasant and workable for both users and staff members, we enforce the following requirements regarding your nickname. Staff reserves the right to change the nickname of any user for any reason.

Failure to comply with these requirements may result in you losing the right to change your nickname. We also reserve the right to discipline users with offensive usernames, regardless of the nickname they're using.

1. No blank or "invisible" names.
2. No slurs or other offensive sentiments.
3. No noisy unicode characters - for example, z̯̯͡a̧͎̺l̡͓̫g̹̲o̡̼̘ or byte order marks.
4. No nicknames designed to annoy other users.

## Consequences

Moderators will be the final arbiter of the consequences of breaches to these rules and will take into account:

1. The nature of the rule broken.
2. The severity of the breach.
3. The behavioural history of the user who has breached the rule.

Moderators may and should convene with other moderators before deciding upon a course of action when a rule has been breached.

## Automatic enforcement

Some moderation may be enforced by bots in situations where the offence is clear and the solution to the situation is one that the moderators have decided can be automatically enforced by a bot. This includes but is not limited to:

1. Changing a user's nickname if it is unacceptable
2. Kicking or banning a user or bot if rampant spamming takes place
3. Attempts to undermine the security of the server are detected.

## Appeals

For those users who have had consequences of rule breaches enacted who feel as though they have a cohesive and persuasive argument as to why the consequences should be reversed, the following procedure should be followed:

1. Any documentation or proof should be collated *before* the petition is made.
2. To petition for an appeal, users should raise an issue on the GitHub repository for this rules document.
3. All petitions will be handled by at least two moderators, not including the moderator who made the original decision.
